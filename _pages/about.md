Hi there! I’m **Zihao Wan** (万子豪). I am a third year undergraduate in Computer Science at Tsinghua University advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/) & Prof. [Peng Li](https://lpeng.net/). Expected graduation in May 2026.

### My Research

Currently, my research interests are focused on:

- Developing lightweight methods to align (multimodal) large language models efficiently.
- Exploring data-efficient methods to finetune models.
- Investigating how models can improve their reasoning ability and function as agents in the workflow.
